# Knights Travails

Knights Travails is an app intended to calculate and display the minimum number of moves and route a chess piece would need to get from a start point to an end point on a chess board. This app uses a custom graph like data structure and breadth first search to calculate the knights moves. This project was built using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Webpack and incorporates JavaScript modules.
