# Knights Travails

Knights Travails is an app intended to calculate and display the minimum number of moves and route a chess piece would need to get from a start point to an end point on a chess board. This app uses a custom graph like data structure and breadth first search to calculate the knight's moves. This project was built using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Webpack and incorporates JavaScript modules. Creating this project allowed me to become comfortable using data structures, which I hope to utilize further in my future projects.
